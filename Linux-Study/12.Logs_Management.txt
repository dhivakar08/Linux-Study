Logs
-----
1.Logs are the files that contain messages about system, Kernel, Services & applications running on it.
2.There are differenet types of log files for storing various information.
3.Separate log file for:
  1.system logs, 2.security logs, 3.cron job logs
4.Log files are very important in troubleshooting issues.

location : /var/log  ---- is the directory where logs are kept persistently

Types of logs 
--------------
1.syslog     - UDP
2.syslog-ng  - TCP & TLS security
3.rsyslog    - RELV                 | conf : /etc/rsyslog.conf          ------- This file having the information about the logs where is go to save

1./var/log/messages - related to authentication & emails,cron jobs etc
2./var/log/secure   - related to security & authentication related messages & errors - like ssh
3./var/log/maillog  - related to mail server
4./var/log/cron     - related to execution of cron jobs
5./var/log/boot.log - related to system startup messages

Note : systemd-analyze command will help to check how much time the system will take to boot
       systemd-analyze blame it will show individual service time to UDP

Log rotate / retention
-----------------------

Normally system will take 4 weeks time to rotate the log

Package of the log rotate : rpmquery logrotate
file location             : /etc/logrotate.conf

Journald daemon
------------------
In rhel 7, log file are also managed by "journald" daemon
journald is a component of systemd
journald captures:
------------------
1.syslog messages
2.Kernel log
3.initial RAM disk 
4.Early boot messages
5.Standard errors & OUTPUT of all Services

# journaldctl   ---- just enter it will show the logs

The journald logs are not available after the system reboot because they are stored in small amount of memory
Location is /run/log/journal 

Timedatectl
-------------
1. timedatectl list-timezones   ---it will list out the time zones
2. timedatectl set-timezone <enter the timezone>
3. Enable the NTP server
   timedatectl set-ntp true 
4. timedatectl set-time <enter the time like 09:09:09>

 Syslog :
 --------
 syslog server is used to store logs and analyze them. 
 Based on criticality act on the events so that you can reduce the problems in server.

 Syslog server configuration
 ----------------------------
 1.# yum install rsyslog* -y

 2.systemctl status rsyslog.service

 3.Configuration file is  /etc/rsyslog.conf
   
 4.In the configuration file uncomment TCP / UDP syslog reception
   # Provides UDP syslog reception
      $ModLoad imudp
      $UDPServerRun 514
   # Provides TCP syslog reception
      $ModLoad imtcp
      $InputTCPServerRun 514

  5.Save the configuration file and restart the services

  6.Note : the default port no of the syslog server is 514

  7.# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/TCP
    # firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/UDP

  8.# firewall-cmd --reload

  9.Verify the port is opened / not using 
    # netstat -antup | grep 514

  Client side configuration
  --------------------------
  1.Ping the server ip and client ip to server 

  2.Configure the firewall permanent same as server entry

  3.Edit the rsyslog configuration file
    Search the #*.* @@remote-host:514 line uncomment and replace the remot -host provide the server ip

  4.Systemctl restart rsyslog.service

  5.Go to the server # cat /var/log/secure      ---- the client logs are stored here
