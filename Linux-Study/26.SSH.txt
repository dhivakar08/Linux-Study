OpenSSH (Secure Shell) Server and Client Configuration 
-------------------------------------------------------
How SSH works
4 steps for ssh working method
1. A cryptographic handshake is made so that the client can verify that it is communicating with the correct server.
2. The transport layer of the connection between the client and remote host is encrypted using a symmetric cipher.
3. The client authenticates itself to the server.
4. The client interacts with the remote host over the encrypted connection

1. # yum install openssh-server* -y

2. systemctl status sshd 

3.SSH default configuration file location
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config

4.If you want to allow only specific group of users make a entry with ssh file bottom like
  AllowGroups sshusers

5.Login ssh users in terminal
  ssh <username>@<ip address>

6.Edit the banner file
  ---------------------
  vim /etc/issue.net      ----- make a banner based on your requirement

 Key Based Authentications
 ---------------------------
7.Normally the key files are stored in .ssh location

8.Create a ssh key using
  # ssh-keygen -t rsa  ------- enter enter

9.Basically create a keypair in client end and copied to server using ssh copyid command
  # ssh-copy-id <username>@server ip
  
10.After go the server .ssh folder and verify authoried.keys file created open and verify using client key both are same
