OpenSSH (Secure Shell) Server and Client Configuration 
-------------------------------------------------------
How SSH works
4 steps for ssh working method
1. A cryptographic handshake is made so that the client can verify that it is communicating with the correct server.
2. The transport layer of the connection between the client and remote host is encrypted using a symmetric cipher.
3. The client authenticates itself to the server.
4. The client interacts with the remote host over the encrypted connection

1. # yum install openssh-server* -y

2. systemctl status sshd 

3.SSH default configuration file location
  /etc/ssh/sshd_config

4.If you want to allow only specific group of users make a entry with ssh file bottom like
  AllowGroups sshusers

5.Login ssh users in terminal
  ssh <username>@<ip address>

6.Edit the banner file
  ---------------------
  vim /etc/issue.net      ----- make a banner based on your requirement

 Key Based Authentications
 ---------------------------
7.Normally the key files are stored in .ssh location

8.Create a ssh key using
  # ssh-keygen -t rsa  ------- enter enter

9.Copy the pub key to server
  # mkdir .ssh
  # chmod 700 .ssh                   ----- same permission is importent to work
  # touch authorized_keys            ----- same permission is importent to work
  # chmod 600 authorized_keys 
  copy and past the pub file contenet to authorized_keys file and save

10.Basically create a keypair in client end and copied to server using ssh copyid command
  # ssh-copy-id <username>@server ip
  
11.After go the server .ssh folder and verify authoried.keys file created open and verify using client key both are same

12.The # w -f command used to check which users are currently logged in the system.
   # w -f

Prohibit the root user from logging in using SSH
--------------------------------------------------
1. Open sshd_config file
   # vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2.modify #permitRootlogin yes to   permitRootlogin no 

3.Restart sshd service

4.# Service sshd restart
 
5.Another option is to only allow key-based ssh login as root 
  # PermitRootLogin without-password    ---- add this line in configuration file

Prohibit password authentication using SSH
--------------------------------------------
Enable PasswordAuthentication yes

1. connect to remote IPv6 enabled server?
   # ssh -6 username@<ip address>

2. Limit SSH access to specific subnet?
   Edit sshd_config file and add subnet as mentioned 20 SSH
   AddressFamily 192.168.0.4/24

Allow and deny ssh access for particular user / Groups 
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Add the below line to allow the users
   AllowUsers  <username 1> <username 2>

2. Allow to particular group
   AllowGroups <Group name>

3. Deny any user or group uisng below mentioned command
   DenyUsers  <username>
