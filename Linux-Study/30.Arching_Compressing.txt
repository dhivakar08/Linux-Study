Arching
-------
archive file is a collection of files and directories stored in one file. The archive file is not compressed 
it uses the same amount of disk space as all the individual files and directories combined.

1.tar -cvf <enter archiname with .tar> <source file destination>
  Here c - create v - verbose (all files) f(file)

2.Update the archive file (alreday created archi you need to update one more file)
  # tar -uvf <name of the archive.tar> *.txt

Note : you cannot update the compressed files

3.Extract the archive files
  # tar -xvf <file name>

Compressing
-----------
A compressed file is a collection of files and directories that are stored in one file and stored 
In a way that uses less disk space than all the individual files and directories combined. 
 If disk space is a concern, compress rarely-used files, or place all such files in a single archive file and compress it.

 Three types of zip method
 --------------------------
 1.gzip -- gunzip - gz
 2.bzip -- bunzip - j bz2   
 3.Normal zip 

 gzip vs bzip2: bzip2 takes more time to compress and decompress than gzip. bzip2 archival size is less than gzip.
 Note: .tbz and .tb2 is same as .tar.bz2

 The three types do all the fuctionality is same but algorithm is different

 1.Checking current directory size
   # du -sh <path>

 2.Gun zip method 
   # tar -cvzf <enter archiname with .tar.gz> <source file destination>  ---- create
   # tar -xvzf <file name>    ---- extract

 3.Bun zip method
   # tar -cvjf <enter archiname with .tar.bz2> <source file destination>  ---- create
   # tar xvfj archive_name.tar.bz2

 4.Zip the file
   # zip <test.zip> <file>
   # zip -r  <test.zip> <directory>      ----- zip the directory
   # zip -d <file name>                  ----- delete the file
   # unzip <file name>

 5.View the tar archive file content without extracting using option tvf
   # tar tvf archive_name.tar

 6.Extract a single file from tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2 file
   To extract a specific file from a tar archive, specify the file name at the end of the tar xvf command
   # tar xvf archive_file.tar /path/to/file
   # tar xvf archive_file.tar /path/to/dir/     ---- directory
