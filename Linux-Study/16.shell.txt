Shells is Linux
----------------

Types of Shells

1.Bourne shell (sh)
2.korn shell   (ksh)    ------ This tree shell combined to linux BASH | Bourne again shell
3.c shell      (csh)

Note : In unix sh & bash are two different shell
       In linux sh & bash are same
       Linux does not have file extentions but our understanding we always use extention so hence for shell script use .sh (or) .bash

SHE BANG
---------
#! --- this is called she-BANG
       It determines the path of interpreter  ex : #!/bin/bash (or) #!/bin/python

Ensure the code inside the script is run by given interpreter
