Suse-Linux
-----------
1.S.u.S.E. was a company founded in Germany in 1992 and was the world’s first provider of an Enterprise Linux distribution.
2.The name S.u.S.E. was an acronym for Software- und System-Entwicklung (Software and Systems Development)


Zypper and YaST are the Package Manager for SUSE Linux, which works on top of RPM.

  Networking check in suse
  ------------------------
  Ip address finding
  1. ifconfig
  2. ip a s
  3. Interface up  --- ifup eth0 / ifdown eth0
  4. router ip checking ip r s

  Ssh connection in suse
  ----------------------
  systemctl start sshd.service

  firewall in suse
  ----------------
  firewalld 

  firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=22/tcp
  firewall-cmd --reload

 Linux Patching
 ------------------
 Why patch linux servers
 -----------------------
 1.Maintanin secure environment for your servers and applications
 2.Maintaining the up-to date working environment  --- it provides the opportunity to provide the new features in the software package

 3.Before do the patching note the linux kernerl version
   # uname -mrs   ---- m - machine r - kernel release s - kernel name
   # hostnamectl

 4.Refersh SELS repository 
   # zypper Refersh

 5.If there any updates available to check using
   # zypper list-patches

 6.list the number of needed patches 
   # zypper patch-check

 7.see a list of the updates on screen
   # zypper list-updates

 8.Note that the zypper patch command does not apply patches from third party repos.
   # zypper patch

 9.update a single package
   # zypper update pkg_name


 Patching fails and resolution
 ------------------------------
 1. Upgrade fails due to insufficient space on boot partition
    Ex : Error: RPM failed:    installing package kernel-default-3.12.67-60.64.18.1.x86_64 needs 17MB on /boot filesystem
    resolution
    -----------
    Move the vmlinux, vmlinuz, and initrd images out of the /boot directory before starting the installation
    hostname:~ # mkdir /tmp/boot
    hostname:~ # cd /boot
    hostname:/boot # mv vmlinu* initrd* /tmp/boot

    the kernel and initrd images are only loaded into memory during the GRUB phase of system boot, 
    moving these files out of /boot once the system is running will not impact the live system

  2.Remove the duplicate packages
    Remove the duplicate packages using
    # package-cleanup
    # package-cleanup --dupes
    # package-cleanup --cleandupes

 Run-level in linux
 -------------------

 configuration file : /etc/init.d
 
 1.0 - Shut-down
 2.1 - single user mode
 3.2 - multiusermode with out Network
 4.3 - multiuser with Network
 5.4 - unused
 6.5 - full multiuser with graphical interface
 7.6 - reboot

 1.Checking current runlevel using 
 # who -r

 2.Change the runlevel using  #init (or) #telinit command
 Ex : 
     1.telinit 6  --- it will reboot the system
     2.init 6 --- it will also reboot the system

  
 3.If you are enable the nginx service 
   # systemctl enable nginx.service
   The link was created under following location
   # cd /etc/systemd/system 

 4.Check particular service is enabled or not using 
   # chkconfig --list --- it show the service enabled or not in old systems
   # systemctl list-unit-files | grep nginx    ---- it will display the service is enabled or not

 Snapper 
 ---------
 Snapper on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is set up as an undo and recovery tool for system changes. 
 By default, the root partition ( / ) of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is formatted with Btrfs .
 It require at least 16GB of partition size 

 # snapper list  ---- it will list out the snapshot

 Types of snapshots
 -------------------
 1.Timeline snapshots
 2.Installation snapshots
 3.Administration snapshots

 Timeline snapshots
 ------------------
 A single snapshot is created every hour. 
 Old snapshots are automatically deleted. By default, the rst snapshot of the last ten days, months, and years are kept. 
 Timeline snapshots are disabled by default.

 Installation snapshots
 -----------------------
 Whenever one or more packages are installed with YaST or Zypper, a pair of snapshots is created
 one before the installation starts (“Pre”) and another one after the installation has finished (“Post”).
 In case an important system component such as the kernel has been installed, the snapshot pair is marked as important ( important=yes ).
 Installation snapshots are enabled by default.

 Administration snapshot
 ------------------------
  Installation snapshots are enabled by default.
  when a YaST module is started (“Pre”) and another when the module is closed (“Post”). Old
  snapshots are automatically deleted.

 Disabling/Enabling Timeline Snapshots
 --------------------------------------
 -Enabling.  snapper -c root set-config "TIMELINE_CREATE=yes"

 -Disabling.  snapper -c root set-config "TIMELINE_CREATE=no"

 Directories That Are Excluded from Snapshots
 --------------------------------------------
 /boot/grub2/i386-pc , /boot/grub2/x86_64-efi , /boot/grub2/powerpc-ieee1275 , /boot/grub2/s390x-emu
 A rollback of the boot loader configuration is not supported. 
 The directories listed above are architecture-specific. The rest two directories are present on AMD64/Intel 64 machines, 
 the latter two on IBM POWER and on IBM z Systems, respectively.

 1./home --- it does not reside on seprate partition
 2./opt,/var/opt --- Third party software usually installed
 3./srv --- contain data from web and FTP 
 4./tmp --- all are temp files
 5./usr/local --- mnually installing softwrae 
 6./var/lib & /var/log --- virtual machine files and logs rae stored in this location

 Disable YaST snapshots
 -----------------------
 sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/yast2

 Enable use of snapper for Yast.
 USE_Snapper="yes"

 Disabling/Enabling Installation Snapshots
 ------------------------------------------
 Enabling: Install the package snapper-zypp-plugin
 Disabling: Uninstall the package snapper-zypp-plugin
 Installation snapshots are enabled by default.

 Snapper undo changes
 ---------------------
 # yast2 snapper 
 Select the snapshot and click on show changes and specify 

 1.snapper list -t pre-post 
 2.snapper -v undochange

 Manually Creating the snapshot
 -------------------------------
 # snapper create --description "<enter your description>"

 Delete the snapshot
 --------------------
 # snapper list 
 # snapper delete <enter the snapshot number>
 # snapper list --- to confirm / go to /root .snapshot to verify

 # snapper delete --sync <Snapshot number>  --- Deletes snapshot 23 for the default ( root ) configuration and makes the freed space available immediately

 Checking the size of the snapshot
 ----------------------------------
 # snapper list ---- it will display the snapshot used size
