About Nginx
------------
Nginx was cerated in 2004 by russian developper Igor sysoev
He consider to design a server to 10000 request and High performance High Concurrency and Low Resource usage
Nginx is not only a webserver it is a reverse proxy server also

Nginx Vs Apache 
---------------
Apache is configured in prefork mode 
The prefork mode is a set number of processor is accept single request at the time

A single nginx process accept multiple request concurrently
Nginx using low resource usages

The nginx is faster then apache because of nginx having faster static resource and higher Concurrency
Nginx is receive 1000 of process in single processing thread and respond to them faster

Installing Nginx
-----------------
The centos / redhat not having nginx package so using epel repository
# yum insatll epel-release
# yum install nginx
Yum does not start the service automatically 
# service nginx start
Checking is process is working
# ps aux | grep nginx          ----- this output you will get master and worker process
# copt the server ip address and paste to browser like http://<server ip>

The nginx configuration file location is /etc/nginx

Nginx custom build
-------------------
# yum check-update
Go to nginx.org and click download link click mainline version right click and copy the link
using wet / curl -o to download
# tar -zxvf <download file name>
go to the extracted nginx directory 
now configure the source code 
# ./configure    ---- c compiler not found
# yum groupinstall "development tools"
# ./configure    ---- to compile the source code if PCRE error means run below pkg
# yum install pcre pcre-devel zlib zlib-devel openssl openssl-devel
# ./configure    ---- compile again
# make
# make install
# cd /etc/nginx  ---- verify nginx installation

Checking nginx version 
# ngnix -v

For help
# nginx -h 

Stop the nginx 
# nginx -s stop    ---- -s is the signal

Adding nginx service to systemd
--------------------------------
# touch /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service

https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/systemd/

# vim /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service and copy past the above link script

In the file modify the below entrys

PIDFile=/var/run/nginx.pid
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/nginx -t 
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nginx 
;wq 

# systemctl start nginx
# ps aux | grep nginx

Creating a virual host
-----------------------
create one director like
# /sites/demo   ---- copy some sample web pages in that directory
taking the backup of the nginx.conf file
vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  ---- delete all 
type below mentioned syntax

events {}
http {
    include mime.types;
    server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 192.168.0.1      ----- <enter the ip address>
    root /sites/demo;            ----- <enter the path like /sites/demo; >
    }
}
;wq 

Note : each virtual context having new server context / server block

Check the nginx configuration 
# ngnix -t     ----- syntax is ok

Reload and Restart
-------------------
Reload - no downtime is required to update the configuration file
Restart - downtime is required

# service nginx reload
