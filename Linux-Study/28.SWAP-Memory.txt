Swap Memory
-----------
Swap memory in Linux ( swap file system) in Linux is used when the amount of RAM (Physical Memory) is Full. 
If system needs more memory resources and the RAM (Physical Memory) full, inactive pages in memory are moved to Swap Space.

Note: Create a swap space consider double size of your Physical memory
      Ex : My Physical memory is 4 GB means my swap space is 8 GB
           If your Physical memory is more than 64 GB swap is 32 is enough

Creating Swap memory
--------------------
1.Checking memory status
  # free -m             ---- it will display the both swap and Physical memory used and available size

2.Create on partition after that command for help enter t and enter 82 and save

3.# partprobe command used to update the kernel table

4.Convert the partition to swap file system
  # mkswap <partition path>

5.Vi /etc/fstab
  <partition path>  swap (because swap doesnot have any mount point) swap defaults 0 0

6.# swapon <partition path>    ------- it used to on the swap partition

7.# swapoff <partition path>   ------- it used to off the swap partition
