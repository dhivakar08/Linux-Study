 Nmcli
 -------
 nmcli is a command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and reporting network status. 
 It can be utilized as a replacement for nm-applet or other graphical clients. 
 nmcli is used to create, display, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate network connections, 
 as well as control and display network device status.

 Network-Commands
 -----------------
 1.IP address display
   1. # ip a 
   2. # ip addr show <interface name> 
   3. The ip com mand may also be used to show statistics a bout network performance. The received
      (RX) and transmitted (TX) packets, errors, and d ropped cou nters can be used to identify network
      issues caused by congestion, low memory, and overruns 
      # ip -s link show <interfacename>
   4. # ip route   ---- checking network route trace
   5. The ping command is used to test connectivity. The command will continue to run until a
      Control - C is pressed unless options are given to limit the number of packets sent.
      #  ping - c3  172 . 25 . X . 254
   6. To trace the path to a remote host, use either trace route or tracepath. Both commands can
      be used to trace a path with UDP packets
      # tracepath access . redhat .com

  2.Troubleshooting ports and services
    1.The ss command is used to display socket statistics. It is similar to the net stat command,
      which is also available but may not be installed by default
      # ss -ta           ------ this command output The " * " is used to represent " all "

  3.Options for ss and netstat
    
    -n = Show numbers instead of names for interfaces and ports.
    -t = Show TCP sockets
    -u = Show UDP sockets
    -l = Show only listening sockets
    -a = Show all sockets
    -p = Show the process of using sockets

   Configuring Networking with nmcli
   ----------------------------------
   Network NetworkManager
   ----------------------
   Network Manager is a daemon that monitors and manages network settings.
   Command-line and graphical tools talk to Network Manager and save configuration files in the
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts  directory

   Viewing network information with nmcli
   ---------------------------------------
   1.To display a list of all connections, use nmcli con show. To list only the active connections, add the --active option.
     # nmcli con show
     # nmcli con show --active

   2.Specify a connection ID (name) to see the details of that connection
     # nmcli con show enp0s3

   3.The nmcli command can also be used to show device status and details
     # nmcli dev show
     # nmcli dev show enp0s3

   Creating network connections with nmcli
   ----------------------------------------
   When creating a new con nection with nmcli, the order of the arguments is important. 
   The common arguments appear first and must include the type and interface. 
    1. # nmcli con add con-name "default " type ethernet ifname eth0
    
    2.Create a new connection named "static" and specify the IP address and gateway. Do not auutoconnect.
      # nmcli con add con-name " static " ifname eth0 autoconnect no type ethernet ip4 172.25.X.10/24 gw4 172.25.X.254

    3.Connection up 
      # nmcli con up static

   Note : If the static connection is lost, the default connection will attempt to autoconnect. 
   To administratively disable an interface and prevent any autoconnection, use nmcli dev disconnect DEVICENAME.

   Modifying network interfaces with nmcli
   ---------------------------------------
    1.Turn off autoconnect.
      # nmcli con mod " static " connection.autoconnect no

    2.Specify a DNS server.
      # nmcli con mod " static " ipv4.dns 172.25.X.254

    3.Add a +/- symbol infront of the argument. Add a secondary DNS server.
      # nmcli con mod " static " +ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8

    4.Replace the static IP address and gateway
      # nmcli con mod " static " ipv4.addresses " 172.25.X.10/24 172.25.x.254 "

    5.Add a secondary IP address without a gateway.
      # nmcli con mod " static" +ipv4.addresses 10.10.10.10/16

   Editing Network Configuration Files
   ------------------------------------
   It is also possible to configure the network by editing interface configuration files. 
   Interface configuration files control the software interfaces for individual network devices.
   These files a reusually named /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<name>, where <name> refers
   to the name of the device or connection that the configuration file controls.

   After modifying the configuration files, run nmcli con reload to make NetworkManager read the configuration changes.
   # nmcli con reload
   # nmcli con down static
   # nmcli con up static

   Configuring Host Names and Name Resolution 
   -------------------------------------------
    1.The hostname command displays or temporarily modifies the system's fully qualified hostname.
      # hostname

    2.A static hostname may be specified in the /etc/host name file. The hostnamectl command is used to modify this file 
      and may be used to view the status of the system's fully qualified hostname.
      # hostnamectl set-hostname desktopX.example.com
      # hostnamectl status

    3.Hostfile location : /etc/hosts

    Note : The static host name is stored in /etc/hostname.  
           Previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux stored the host name as a variable in the /etc/sysconfig/network file.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.nmcli general status   ---it show which are the connectivity is enabled
 2.nmcli dev status   ----- how many device are currently connected / idle information

 More trouble shooting process
 -------------------------------
 3.nmcli device show <interface name>  --- it give lot off additional informational

 4.nmcli connnection show  ---- how many device / profile are activated

 Make a new connection using nmcli
 ---------------------------------
 5.nmcli connection add con-name Home ifname enth0s3 type ethernet 

 Delete the connection
 --------------------
 6.nmcli connection delete <connection name>

 modify the connection
 ----------------------
 7.nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.address 192.168.0.37/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.dns 192.168.0.24 
   +ipv4.dns 4.4.4.4 connection.autoconnection yes

 configuration file location
 ------------------------------
 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<profile name>

 8.nmcli connection up <connection name>

 9.nmcli connection down <connection name>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Teaming 
----------------
Use network teaming or bonding to configure aggregated network links between two Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
 
configuration -  man teamd.conf

Teaming Mechanisum
--------------------
1.Roundrobin
2.Load balancing
3.Active Backup
4.Broadcast

1.Active Backup configuration
------------------------------
 Active Backup - Watches for link changes and selects active port to be used for data transfers.

 1.Configure team we must have more then one NIC

 2.# ifconfig / ip link to verify the NICs 

 3.Creat master team
  # nmcli con add con-name team type team ifname team config '{"runner":{"name": "activebackup"}}'
  # man teamd.conf ------- file to verify the configuration syntax
  # nmcli con show  ------ to verify
 4.Create slave1 configuration
  # nmcli con add con-name team-slave1 type team-slave ifname <new interface name like enp0s8> master team connection.autoconnect yes
  # nmcli con show 

 5.Create slave2 configuration
  # nmcli con add con-name team-slave2 type team-slave ifname <new interface name like enp0s9> master team connection.autoconnect yes
  # nmcli con show 

 6.# nmcli con up team

 7.# teamdctl team state    ------- using this command to verify the team status

 8.If you want to down any team-slave1 using below this command
  # nmcli con down team-slave1

2.Load Balance configuration
-----------------------------
 Load Balance - To  do  passive  load  balancing, runner only sets up BPF hash function which will determine port for packet transmit. To do
                active load balancing, runner moves hashes among available ports trying to reach perfect balance.

 1.Creat master team
  # nmcli con add con-name team type team ifname team config '{"runner":{"name": "loadbalance"}}'
  # nmcli con show

 2.slave creation step same as active backup method

 3.# nmcli con modify ipv4.address <ip>/24 ipv4.method manual connection.autoconnect yes

 4.# nmcli con up team

 5.# ifconfig ----- to check the team ip and ping the ip

 6.# teamdctl team state  ---- to verify the team state

3.Round robinn configuration
-----------------------------
 Round robin -  Simple runner which directs the team device to transmits packets in a round-robin fashion.

 1.Creat master team
  # nmcli con add con-name team type team ifname team config '{"runner":{"name": "roundrobin"}}'
  # nmcli con show

 2.slave creation step same as active backup method

 3.# nmcli con modify ipv4.address <ip>/24 ipv4.method manual connection.autoconnect yes

 4.# nmcli con up team

 5.# ifconfig ----- to check the team ip and ping the ip

 6.# teamdctl team state  ---- to verify the team state

4.Broadcast configuration
-----------------------------
 Broadcast -  Simple runner which directs the team device to transmit packets via all ports.

 1.Creat master team
  # nmcli con add con-name team type team ifname team config '{"runner":{"name": "broadcast"}}'
  # nmcli con show

 2.slave creation step same as active backup method

 3.# nmcli con modify ipv4.address <ip>/24 ipv4.method manual connection.autoconnect yes

 4.# nmcli con up team

 5.# ifconfig ----- to check the team ip and ping the ip

 6.# teamdctl team state  ---- to verify the team state
