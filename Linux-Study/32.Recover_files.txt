Linux boot level troubleshooting steps
---------------------------------------
1.Intiramfs

  Location : /boot
  
  The difference between initrd and initramfs

   Initrd is basically set of blocks that gets copied to allocated chunks of memory then treated as a block device normall file system
   created on the ram disk the initrd is a inital ram disk that mounted during boot up
   Initrd used in rhel 5

   Initramfs --- rhel 6 is a CPIO archive of files that allocated during bootup the kernal load the files in to the virtual file system
   is called rootfs

   Ex : remove initramfs file in /boot and restart the system
 
   In linux boot process bios go the bootable device like HDD and it hist to first sector of the bootable device MBR 512 bytes
   MBR look the boot loader and the patition table here primary bootlaoder pass the signal to secondary boot loader that contain in /boot
   so that reason it will not boot

   troubleshooting steps
   -----------------------
   1.Insert the iso file
   2.Reboot and select the system to rescue mode 
   3.Press 1 to continue
   4.Enter
   5.# chroot /mnt/sysimage
   6.cd /boot
   7.dracut -f initramfs-$(uname -r) initramfs-$(uname -r)   (or) # uname -r instead of -$(uname -r) enter the kernel version
     Here dracut is a tool for restore initramfs file it contain rhel versions defaulty
  

 2.Recover /etc/passwd file
   
   Note : do not test on production system

   # cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd

 3.Recover /etc/shadow
    
    # cp /etc/shadow- /etc/shadow

 4.Recover /etc/inittab 
   Recover inittab you need to install the inittab rpm
   # rpm -q -f /etc/inittab   ---- it will provide the rpm pkg name
   # rpm -ivh <pkg name>
   Once its done the file created in /etc/inittab Location

 5.Recover /etc/fstab
   If /etc/fstab file is deleted or some one make a wrong entry after system reboot it will not up it goes maintanance mode

   1.After restart system in manitanance mode enter root passwd
   2.In maintanace mode all the files are in read only permission include root partition also so we remount the root partition and edit the file
   3.mount -o remount rw /
   4.Now edit the file using /etc/fstab and make it correct and restart the system

   If someone delete the fstab file us ethe below mentioned method to recover it
   # check if you are root you can type #who or #whoami
   # cat /proc/mounts > /etc/fstab
   # chmod 644 /etc/fstab

  6.The Difference between fstab and mtab
   1./etc/fstab is a created by the user. It contains list of volumes to be mounted by mount.
   2./etc/mtab is a created by the system. It contains a list of currently mounted devices.
   3.The format of the files is similar. After mounting a new device, copy the relevant line from /etc/mtab to /etc/fstab
     so that it will be auto-mounted after boot or when calling mount -a
