Linux boot level troubleshooting steps
---------------------------------------
1.Intiramfs

  Location : /boot
  
  The difference between initrd and initramfs

   Initrd is basically set of blocks that gets copied to allocated chunks of memory then treated as a block device normall file system
   created on the ram disk the initrd is a inital ram disk that mounted during boot up
   Initrd used in rhel 5

   Initramfs --- rhel 6 is a CPIO archive of files that allocated during bootup the kernal load the files in to the virtual file system
   is called rootfs

   Ex : remove initramfs file in /boot and restart the system
 
   In linux boot process bios go the bootable device like HDD and it hist to first sector of the bootable device MBR 512 bytes
   MBR look the boot loader and the patition table here primary bootlaoder pass the signal to secondary boot loader that contain in /boot
   so that reason it will not boot
