Run Levels
-----------
The run level in linux are nothing but how to the system will boot in what mode

We can see the run-level in following path : /etc/initab

Default runlevel
------------------
0 - Halt / shutdown (Do not set initdefault to this)
1 - Single user mode (root user can loggin there is no graphical interface)
2 - Multiuser without NFS 
3 - Full multiuser mode with NFS  (no graphical)
4 - unused
5 - X11 (Graphical interface)
6 - reboot 

Checking the current run level 
# who -r   --- it will display the current run level status

2.Change the runlevel using  #init (or) #telinit command
 Ex : 
     1.telinit 6  --- it will reboot the system
     2.init 6 --- it will also reboot the system

3.To set the default target, run the command below
  # systemctl set-default multi-user.target  

4.The chkconfig tool is used in RedHat based systems (like CentOS) to control what services are started at which runlevels.
  # chkconfig --list

5.Check particular service is enabled or not using 
   # chkconfig --list --- it show the service enabled or not in old systems like rhel 5 or 6
   # systemctl list-unit-files | grep nginx    ---- it will display the service is enabled or not

6.If you are enable the nginx service 
   # systemctl enable nginx.service
   The link was created under following location
   # cd /etc/systemd/system
