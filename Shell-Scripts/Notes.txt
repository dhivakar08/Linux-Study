What is shell-scripting
-----------------------
A sequence of the command written in the one file and execute is called shell script


Linux common syntax
--------------------
command [option] [input]
In linux every command after may/may not have option and may/may not input to execute
Ex : ls -l /tmp 
ls  --- [command] -l --- [option] /tmp ---[input]

Echo 
-----
The echo is used to print something on the screen

echo [option]    ---- here echo is a command and [option] --- is -e & -n 

-n Option is used to disabling triling of new line [Same line it will print Ex: echo -n hai]

1. -e ---enable esc sequance  
   \n --- new line
   \t --- tab space
   \e --- enable color

 When ever you are using -e option provide the input in double quotes

 Note : man console_code --- it will provide more information about the color

 Redirectors
 ------------
 STDIN  --- it using less then symbol    <
 STDOUT --- it using greater then symbol >
 Stdout ---  > 
 Stderr --- 2>
 
 Examples
 ---------
 1.stdout ---- ls >out 
 2.stderr ----  ls print 2>out
 3.Both out & err ---- ls print Desktop &>out
 4. >out 2>&1 ---- any error will come it append to one
 5./dev/null ----- It used to nullify the output [It act like a trash ] once you nullify you cannot retrive back
             ----- It is character special file
 # >/dev/null  

 output and error to the same file using --- &>
 >> The double Redirectors instead of overwritting it will append the content

 ls >out ---- it will create a file and send the out to the file out but not display on the screen

 Tee command
 ------------
 The tee command used to create a file and send the output to the file and disply the output on the screen also
 # ls |tee <file name like : test>

 In tee command you want to append you can use "-a" option 
 # ls |tee -a test
 
 The disadvantage of the shell script
 -------------------------------------
 If the command fails it never stop the script it continue to execute next command 

 Exit status
 ------------
 The status of the previous executed command
 The range from 0-255
 0 - Sucessful
 1-255 - Non Sucessful
 Executing exitstatus using variable called as "?"

 Ex: echo $?
 Always use the value from 1-125 is the best practice to use the script 126-255 are the system defined values
 126 --- is a permission denied error
 127 --- command not found
 128 + n --- kill signals   (total kill signals are 64) here -n is the kill signal numbers

 Pipe command
 -------------
 It used to combine two commands. output of the one command to input of another command
